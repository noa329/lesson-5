# Library Server API

A RESTful API for managing a library system. This is a learning project created to practice backend development using Node.js and Express.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to implement a library management API that supports:
* Managing books
* Managing users
* Borrowing and returning books
* Working with a database
* Designing a RESTful server architecture

## Technologies & Libraries

* Node.js
* Express.js
* JavaScript (ES Modules)

Main libraries used:

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import cors from 'cors';
import morgan from 'morgan';
import { config } from 'dotenv';
```

## Project Structure

The server is organized using dedicated routes:
* Book routes
* User routes

Each route handles CRUD operations according to REST principles.

## Main Routes

### Books

* Get all books (with search and pagination): `GET /books?page=1&limit=5&name=searchWord`
* Get book by ID: `GET /books/:id`
* Add a new book: `POST /books`
* Update book details: `PUT /books/:id`
* Borrow a book: `PATCH /books/borrow/:id/:username`
* Return a book: `PATCH /books/:id`
* Delete a book: `DELETE /books/:id`

### Users

* Get all users: `GET /users`
* User sign-in: `GET /users/sign-in`
* User sign-up: `POST /users/sign-up`

## Installation & Running

### Prerequisites

* Node.js
* Database (connection string is defined in `.env`)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noa329/Library-server.git
cd Library-server
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with your database connection details, for example:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
PORT=3000
```

### Run the Server

```bash
npm start
```

## Project Status

Educational project – created for learning and practicing backend and REST API development.

## Notes

* No automated tests included
* No linting configuration
* Focus is on code structure, logic, and clarity
